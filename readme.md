*:Guessing based on chip specifications, havenâ€™t tried it yet.

**:There are too many naming approaches for puya MCU, some MCUs such as PY32L020, PY32C613, etc. I didn't buy these chips, if you have them, please contribute relevant information. You can try above series with the same flash, ram, and clock speed, which may work because they are most likely produced from the same die.
